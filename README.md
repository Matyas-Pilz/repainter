Simple repaint and rotate objects with only specified paramtype. Primary for creative builders. I created it for my other mods - Nodehouses, Noderoads, Owires...
Tools:
Repainter - repaints object: on left click - one color per click, on rightclick - more colors per click (4, 8, 8, 4)
Rotator - rotate object, similar as screwdriver: on left click - one, on rightclick - part (for facedir and degrotate)

A - (color)facedir
B - (color)4dir
C - (color)wallmounted
D - (color)degrotate

This mod does not include any palette, it uses palettes specified for each node.
